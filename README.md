# ReSculpt - "Turning waste into opportunity"

Today, we face a big problem with a lot of waste in our society, which is harmful to people and animals. This happens because we buy and throw away things quickly, especially things we use once and then throw away. The way we get rid of our trash also makes the problem worse. Our plan is to improve how we deal with waste by turning things we use at home into new and useful things. This way, we can use them again instead of throwing them away. This not only helps the environment but also lets us create cool and useful items for our homes.

## Problem Statement

Empowering Sustainable Practices: Bridging Waste Contributors and Artisans Through an Innovative Upcycling App.


## Solution

**1) For Artisans :**
We generate a significant amount of household waste regularly.
This waste can be repurposed to create decorative and innovative products by collaborating with skilled artisans.
Anyone can contribute their household waste for this purpose, fostering a sense of community engagement.

**2) Uploading Innovative products:**
Artisans can sell the creative products they make through a dedicated marketplace.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend** : ReactJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript

**Backend** : NodeJS, ExpressJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, TypeScript

**Features:**

**1)Upload Requirements:**
After logging in, artisans can easily upload their material requirements.
For instance, if an artisan needs 10kg of plastic, they can use the upload page to fill a simple form specifying their needs for creating innovative products.


**2)Visibility to Users:**
Uploaded requirements are visible to all users.
If a user has the requested material, such as plastic bottles, they can use the 'Contribute' button to offer their waste.


**3)Contribution Process:**
Contributors' waste is collected by a delivery agent from their doorstep once the artisan's requirement is fulfilled.
The collected waste is then delivered to the artisan's location after successful payment.


**4)Innovative Product Creation:**
Upon receiving the contributed waste, artisans can use it to craft innovative products.
These products can be easily uploaded to the marketplace through the app for selling.
